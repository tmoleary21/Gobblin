# Gobblin

## Object of the Game

Be the first player to align 4 gobblets in a row.

## Setting Up

Each player chooses a color and arranges his gobblets in 3 stacks of 4 gobblets each. Only the 3 biggest gobblets are showing at the beginning. These stacks are called external stacks.

## Playing

In turns, players can either put a new gobblet on the board, move one of their gobblets already on the board to any empty space or gobble up any smaller size gobblet with a bigger gobblet already in play.

If you put a new gobblet in play, you must place it on an empty square. However, there is one exception to this rule: if your opponent already has 3 gobblets in a row on the board, you may gobble up 1 of the 3 pieces in line with a gobblet taken directly from one of your external stacks.

If you play all 12 of your pieces on the board before the game is over, you simply continue playing with the pieces on the board until a winner or a draw is declared.

## Winning

The first player to align 4 gobblets in a row wins. The gobblets forming the line do not all have to be the same size and can be lined up vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

### Notes on Play

**Playing from Stacks:** Players must play pieces in the order they appear, starting from the top.

**Gobbling:** You can gobble up your own pieces. You can gobble up any smaller size gobblet; it does not have to be the next size down.

**Touched (Selected) Gobblet:** Once you touch (select) a gobblet that is on the board, you must play it. If you touch (select) a gobblet that cannot be played, you automatically lose the game.

**Uncovering Gobblets:** You can move any gobblet on the board whether it is covering another gobblet or not. However, if you uncover one of your opponent's pieces, and this move reveals a line of 4 of your opponent's pieces, you lose unless you can place your gobblet over a difference piece in this same line of 4.

**Draws:** The game is declared a draw if 3 repetitions of identical moves between whites and blacks occur or by mutual agreement between players.

**Ages:** Gobblet is for adults only.
